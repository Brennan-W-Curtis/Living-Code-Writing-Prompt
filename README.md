# Plume

Plume is a simple text editor designed to facilitate writers focusing on their craft within a constructive environment free of distractions that also helps set healthy boundaries when staying accountable to target goals.

## Underlying Motivation

This project is an exercise in furthering my understanding of a variety the web technologies including React, JavaScript (ES6+), API Integrations, and Firebase.

Plume was first conceived as a creative writing application meant to assist the user with prompts and recognizing when they should consider taking a break based on their inactivity. 

In the past I've had difficulty with setting proper boundaries for myself and the work I embark on with me often find myself getting lost within it.

So I felt this would be a good framework to deepen my understanding of technologies I'm already familiar with.    

## Key Features

- Users have the option to register create an account that provides access to more features.
- An idle timer meant to notify users with a warning if a 15 seconds of consistent inactivty has past.
- A countdown timer where users can set a time for themselves if they prefer writing within a schedule.
- If they find starting difficult we provide writing prompts to help them draw inspiration from.  
- Authenticated users can also contribute writing prompts to our realtime database to assist others.
- They also have ability to save countless entries with our cloud database and resume when they desire.
- If they're content with their writing authenticated users also have the choice of downloading their work.
- We also provide spotify integration where they can select playlists from their premium accounts to play.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
